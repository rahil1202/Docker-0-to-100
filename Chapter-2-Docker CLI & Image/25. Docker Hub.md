## 🧠 Topic 5: Docker Hub

### 📌 What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is like an app store 🛒 but for Docker images. You can find thousands of ready-to-use images like Ubuntu, Nginx, Redis, etc.

### 🧪 Example:
```bash
# Search for images
$ docker search node

# Pull a popular image
$ docker pull node
```

You can also push your own images there!

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
It’s like a toy shop 🧸! You go in and say, “I want a robot,” and it gives you a robot. Docker Hub is where Docker gets all the ready-made toys (images).

## 🧠 Topic 3: Creating and Running Containers

### 📌 What is a container?
A **container** is a running instance of an image. When you say “run the image,” Docker creates a container and starts it.

```bash
# Run a container from nginx image
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx

# Stop the container
$ docker stop <container_id>
```

`-d` means detached mode (runs in background), and `-p` maps a port from your computer to the container.

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
The image is your toy’s blueprint 🧩. The container is the actual built toy 🧸 that you can play with.

You say: “Build it!” — Docker makes the toy and lets you play with it.

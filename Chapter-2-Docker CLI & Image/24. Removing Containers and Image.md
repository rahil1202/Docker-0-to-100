## 🧠 Topic 4: Removing Containers and Images

### 📌 Clean-up Time!
Over time, you’ll have many containers and images. You can delete them to free up space.

```bash
# Remove a stopped container
$ docker rm <container_id>

# Remove an image
$ docker rmi <image_name>

# Remove all stopped containers
$ docker container prune
```


### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
When you’re done playing, you clean up your toys 🧹. `docker rm` is like putting away one toy. `docker prune` is like tidying up everything at once!

## 🧠 Topic 1: Docker CLI (Command Line Interface)

### 📌 What is the Docker CLI?
The Docker CLI is a tool you use in the terminal to talk to Docker. You type commands like `docker run` or `docker build` to tell Docker what to do.

### 📋 Common CLI Commands:
```bash
# Check Docker version
$ docker version

# List all running containers
$ docker ps

# List all containers (running + stopped)
$ docker ps -a

# Pull an image from Docker Hub
$ docker pull ubuntu
$ docker pull redis
$ docker pull nginx
$ docker pull node

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
$ docker build -t my-image .

# Run a container from an image
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-image

# List all images
$ docker images

# Remove a container
$ docker rm <container_id>


# Run a container
$ docker run hello-world
```

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
Think of the CLI as your walkie-talkie 📟 to Docker. You say: "Docker, bring me a toy!" and Docker listens and gives it to you. Just speak its special commands like magic spells 🪄.

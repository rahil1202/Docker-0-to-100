## 🧠 Topic 2: What Are Docker Images?

### 📌 Docker Image Basics:
A Docker **image** is like a blueprint 📘. It tells Docker exactly how to create a container. Images are built using instructions written in a **Dockerfile**.

Think of it as a frozen snapshot of an app — like a recipe card 🍳 for baking a specific cake.

### 🧪 Example:
```bash
$ docker pull nginx        # pulls an image
$ docker images            # lists images
```

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
A Docker image is like your LEGO instruction book 📖. It says “Step 1: place a red block. Step 2: place a window.”

You follow it to build the toy. Docker follows it to build your app!

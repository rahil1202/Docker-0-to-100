## 🧠 Topic 4: How Docker Works (Architecture)

Docker is made up of several parts:
- **Docker Engine**: The main program running Docker
- **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`): Does all the background work
- **Docker CLI**: The command-line tool you type commands into
- **Docker Images**: Blueprints or recipes for apps
- **Docker Containers**: Running apps created from images

### 🧪 Try this:
```bash
$ docker version
```
It shows the version of Docker installed.

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
Let’s say you have a robot 🤖:
- The **engine** is its power
- The **daemon** is its brain 🧠
- The **CLI** is your remote 🎮
- The **image** is a blueprint 📘
- The **container** is the built robot doing its job 🛠️

So you tell Docker: “Use this blueprint and build a robot!” And Docker says: “Okay!”

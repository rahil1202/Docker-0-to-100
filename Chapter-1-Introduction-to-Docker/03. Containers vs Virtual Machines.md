## 🧠 Topic 3: Containers vs Virtual Machines

### ⚖️ The Difference:
Both containers and virtual machines (VMs) let you run apps in isolation. But:
- A **VM** needs a full operating system (OS) for every app.
- A **container** shares the OS of the host, so it’s lighter and faster.

| Feature            | Virtual Machine            | Container                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Size               | Big (GBs)                   | Small (MBs)                      |
| Startup Time       | Minutes                     | Seconds                          |
| OS Included?       | Yes                         | No (shares host OS)              |
| Performance        | Slower                      | Faster                           |
| Portability        | Lower                       | Higher                           |

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
A virtual machine is like building a big house 🏠 for every guest. It takes time and money.

A container is like giving each guest their own hotel room 🛏️ in the same building. They still have privacy, but it’s faster and cheaper to set up.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Docker

Welcome to Docker! This chapter will help you understand what Docker is, why it’s useful, and how it works — even if you’ve never written a line of code.

Each topic will be explained normally **first**, and then again at the end **as if you're five years old**, using simple language.

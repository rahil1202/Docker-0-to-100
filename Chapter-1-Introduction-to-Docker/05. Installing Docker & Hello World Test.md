## 🧠 Topic 5: Installing Docker & Hello World Test

To use Docker, you need to install it on your computer.

### 💻 On Windows/macOS:
1. Download Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Install it like any other app
3. Open Terminal and check version:
```bash
$ docker --version
```

### 🐧 On Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Log out and back in, or reboot the system.

### 🚀 Run Hello World:
```bash
$ docker run hello-world
```
This command pulls a small test image and runs it to confirm Docker is working.

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
Imagine Docker is a new game console 🎮. You have to install it before you play. Once it’s ready, you press a button and the console says “Hello, I’m working!” 👋

That’s what this does:
```bash
$ docker run hello-world
```
It’s Docker’s way of waving at you to say it’s ready! 🐳💙



## ✅ Chapter Summary
- Docker helps you run apps in portable boxes called containers 📦
- It works the same everywhere and is faster than older methods like virtual machines
- You build containers from images, and manage them with simple commands
- Installing Docker is easy and you can test it with `hello-world`

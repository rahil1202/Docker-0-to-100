## 🧠 Topic 3: Building Your First Docker Image

### 🔨 Build an Image from a Dockerfile:
Assuming your Dockerfile is in the current folder:
```bash
$ docker build -t my-app .
```

- `-t my-app` gives your image a name
- `.` means “build from here” (current folder)

### 🧪 View Built Image:
```bash
$ docker images
```

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
You wrote your recipe card 📝. Now you tell Docker, “Make the cake!” 🍰 And Docker makes it and puts it in the fridge (your image list).

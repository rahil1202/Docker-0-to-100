## 🧠 Topic 4: Run Your Custom Image

### 🚀 Start the Container:
```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```
- This runs the image as a container.
- `-p 3000:3000` maps your local port 3000 to the app’s port.

Now you can visit your app at `http://localhost:3000`

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
You made the cake (image), and now you're eating it 🎂 (running the container). You open the fridge, take it out, and serve it on your plate!

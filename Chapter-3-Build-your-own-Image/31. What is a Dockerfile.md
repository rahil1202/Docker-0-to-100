## 🧠 Topic 1: What is a Dockerfile?

### 📌 Dockerfile Basics:
A **Dockerfile** is a plain text file with step-by-step instructions for building a Docker image which then used in building container. Think of it like a recipe 🍳.

Each line tells Docker what to do — like installing software, copying files, or setting environment variables.

### 🧪 Example:
```Dockerfile
# Start from a base image
FROM node:18

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json
COPY package.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy all files
COPY . .

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

This Dockerfile builds a Node.js app container!

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
A Dockerfile is like a recipe card 📖 for making your favorite cake 🎂. You write:
- Step 1: Get flour
- Step 2: Add eggs
- Step 3: Bake!

Docker follows your steps and makes a cake (your app!) 🍰

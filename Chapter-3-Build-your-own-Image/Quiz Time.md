## ðŸ¤¯ Mind-Boggling Docker Facts

- Your image can contain an entire **web server**, database, or full dev environment
- You can have a container running on a Raspberry Pi ðŸ¤¯
- Docker images are built **layer by layer**, and layers are shared across images (so it's super efficient!)
- Docker Hub has **millions** of pre-built images for you to use!
- You can even build **Windows** containers with Docker! (but itâ€™s a bit different)
- Docker is used by **90%** of Fortune 500 companies! (seriously, itâ€™s that popular)

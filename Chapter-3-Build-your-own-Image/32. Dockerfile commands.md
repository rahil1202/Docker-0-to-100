## 🧠 Topic 2: Important Dockerfile Commands

### 🧾 Common Instructions:
- `FROM`: Start with a base image
- `WORKDIR`: Set the folder where commands will run
- `COPY`: Copy files from your machine into the container
- `RUN`: Run a command (e.g. install packages)
- `CMD`: What to do when the container starts

### 🧪 Example:
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /code
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
### Example 2 : Making a file to run a backend server
```Dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
### Example 3 : Making a file to run a Frontend
```Dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /dist
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev]
```

### 🍼 Explain Like I’m 5:
It’s like LEGO instructions 🧱:
- FROM = pick your starter pack
- COPY = put pieces in place
- RUN = follow special steps
